This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at <a href="https://www.saxonweber.com/">www.saxonweber.com</a> (the &#8220;Site&#8221;) and the services owned and operated by Saxon Weber (collectively with the Site, the &#8220;Service&#8221;). By using the Site or Service in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published by Saxon Weber from time to time on the Site, each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by Saxon Weber from time to time without notice to you.</p>
<p>Your use of the Site is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect on the date of use. You agree to access the information on the Site solely for the purpose of evaluation of potential investment opportunities on the Site. Saxon Weber may may modify this Agreement at any time and without prior notice.Your continued use of and access to the Saxon Weber Site constitutes your acknowledgement of, and agreement to, the then current Terms of Use and to having reviewed the most current version of the Terms of Use. Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements between you and Saxon Weber, including any customer or account agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available on the Site. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Saxon Weber, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for the Service or otherwise. If you do not agree to all the terms of this Agreement and/or Saxon Weber’s Privacy Policy, you are not eligible to participate in Saxon Weber’s Service or otherwise use this Site. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including Companies (&#8220;Issuers&#8221;) and Accredited Investors, as defined by SEC Regulation D Rule 501 (&#8220;Investors&#8221;), who in any way use the Site or Service provided by Saxon Weber (in each case, a&#8221;User&#8221;).</p>
<p>Saxon Weber reserves the right, in its sole discretion, without any obligation and without any notice requirement, to change, improve or correct the information, materials and descriptions on the Site and to suspend and/or deny access to the Site for any reason. The information and materials on the Site may contain typographical errors or inaccuracies. Any dated information is published as of its date only, and Saxon Weber does not undertake any obligation or responsibility to update or amend any such information. Saxon Weber may discontinue or change any product or service described in or offered on the Saxon Weber Site at any time. Saxon Weber further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason. You agree that Saxon Weber and its subsidiaries and affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.</p>
<p><strong>Investor Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>The Service is available only to Accredited Investors who are at east 18 years old. You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. Saxon Weber may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions. If you are using the Site on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on such entity&#8217;s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify Saxon Weber for violations of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Securities Products</strong></p>
<p>Company listings on this Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private investments. Securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded and, therefore, are less liquid. Additionally, Investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements. Companies seeking private placement investments tend to be in earlier stages of development and have not yet been fully tested in the public marketplace. Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment. For those reasons, these offerings may be made available only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. As with all alternative investments, investors must meet certain eligibility tests to qualify as purchasers. Currently, entities must have assets of at least $5 million (or all individual owners meet accredited investor tests). Individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million excluding primary residence or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 with spouse) with the expectation of the same income in the current year. Associated persons of Saxon Weber who are Accredited Investors may choose, from time to time, to invest in offerings listed on the Site.</p>
<p>The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Site do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. Saxon Weber may not have verified all information contained in offering materials on the Site. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.</p>
<p>None of the information contained in the publicly available portions of the Site constitutes a recommendation, solicitation or offer buy or sell any securities, options or other financial instruments or other assets or provide any investment advice or service. Not all Investors are granted access to all portions of the Site (including deal rooms). Investors may choose to invest in a company without accessing all portions of the Site. Please note that Investors may not see all information regarding a company prior to making investment decisions. The information contained in the Site has been prepared by without reference to any particular User&#8217;s investment requirements or financial situation. The information and services provided on the Site are not provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where Saxon Weber is not authorized to provide such information or services. Some products and services described in the Site may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all clients.</p>
